## Short Bio
<style>From September 2024, I will be joining Durham University and the newly established [Space Research Centre](https://www.durham.ac.uk/research/institutes-and-centres/space-research-centre/) as an Assistant Professor. I am currently an Assistant Professor in Space Engineering, at the [School of Metallurgy and Materials](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/metallurgy-materials), University of Birmingham, UK. My research interests include vision-based robotic grasping and manipulation, and applications in space robotics. I was a JPL Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Mobility and Robotics Section (347)](https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/) at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, working on machine vision and pose estimation for the Mars Sample Return Mission. I was also a Research Fellow at the [School of Electronic Engineering](https://www.york.ac.uk/physics-engineering-technology/), University of York, UK, working on evolultionary robotics and evolvable gripper morphologies for robotic grasping. I was also a Research Fellow at [Surrey Space Centre](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/surrey-space-centre), University of Surrey, UK, researching visually-guided grasp synthesis for orbital robotics. {text-align: justify}</style>
